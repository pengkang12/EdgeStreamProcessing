Storm is a distributed realtime computation system. Similar to how Hadoop provides a set of general primitives for doing batch processing, Storm provides a set of general primitives for doing realtime computation. Storm is simple, can be used with any programming language, [is used by many companies](http://storm.apache.org/Powered-By.html), and is a lot of fun to use!

The [Rationale page](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Rationale.html) explains what Storm is and why it was built. [This presentation](http://vimeo.com/40972420) is also a good introduction to the project.

Storm has a website at [storm.apache.org](http://storm.apache.org). Follow [@stormprocessor](https://twitter.com/stormprocessor) on Twitter for updates on the project.
